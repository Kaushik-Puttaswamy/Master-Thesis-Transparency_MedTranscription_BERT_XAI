# Literature Review Summary

Medical text transcription is vital for effective healthcare communication and decision-making. AI-driven methods, including BERT-based models like BioBERT and ClinicalBERT, show promise but often lack interpretability. Integrating XAI approaches like SHAP and LIME is still developing, and systematic comparisons across medical specialties are needed. Unstructured clinical notes and limited annotated datasets present challenges, requiring domain-specific preprocessing and collaboration with clinical professionals to improve AI model accuracy and practicality.

# Research Gap

Despite advancements with BERT-based models in medical text transcription, there is a lack of systematic studies comparing their performance across medical disciplines. Current research often neglects interpretability and transparency, which are essential for clinical adoption. The integration of XAI methods like SHAP and LIME is still in its early stages, and comprehensive comparisons between traditional and transformer-based models using standardized datasets are missing. Additionally, the challenges of unstructured clinical notes and limited annotated datasets necessitate improved preprocessing and data augmentation techniques.

# Research Methodology

This study delves into the application of BERT-based language models for classifying medical text transcriptions across various disciplines, addressing significant gaps in existing literature. By systematically comparing BERT variations and integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques, the research aims to enhance both accuracy and interpretability in clinical contexts. Through rigorous data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and robust model evaluation, the study strives to provide actionable insights to improve the reliability and ethical implementation of AI-driven medical transcription categorization.
