# Master-Thesis-Transparency_MedTranscription_BERT_XAI
# Overview

The proposed master's thesis aims to enhance the transparency and interpretability of BERT in medical transcription. It will investigate the performance of BERT when fine-tuned on medical-specific data and apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to elucidate its decision-making process. The goal is to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical transcription systems, thereby aiding clinical decision-making.
